# Real Estate Checklist Tracker

## Project Overview
This project aims to streamline communication between real estate agents and their customers by providing a tool that tracks all the client's missing documents and payments, ensuring transparency and organization throughout the leasing process.

While the primary focus is on leasing, the tool also shares many similarities with the processes of buying and selling real estate. As a result, the project may eventually extend its capabilities to assist in these areas as well.

## Key Features
- Track missing documents and payments for real estate leasing.
- Ensure clear communication between agents and customers.
- Enhance transparency throughout the leasing process.
- Potential future expansion to assist in buying and selling real estate.

## Future Considerations
Though the tool is initially focused on leasing, it has the potential to be adapted for other real estate transactions such as buying and selling, providing agents and clients with a broader solution for managing property deals.
